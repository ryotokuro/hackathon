Ethan has just gotten his new smart pillbox from Kusuribako. So the first thing he wants to do is set it up.

SAKSHAM: Alexa, set up my pillbox

ask smart pillbox when do you need to take your medication?



SAKSHAM: 10am, 3pm and 8pm

ask smart pillbox daily reminder



----------------
Later at 10am, it's time for Ethan to take his pills. His pillbox lights up, and Alexa alerts him to take his medicine.

*RED LIGHT UP on BOX*

ask smart pillbox buzz alarm

SAKSHAM: OH! time to take my medication! (forgot got distracted)


Since Ethan has dementia, even though Alexa has reminded him to take his pills, Ethan forgets. So in another 15 minutes, Alexa reminds Ethan again.

ask smart pillbox send prompt

SAKSHAM: no *go for pills, and close box*

*LIGHTS TURN OFF*



Since Ethan has dementia, although he just took his pills, he has already forgotten. But thankfully, Ethan can just ask Alexa if he's taken his pills.



SAKSHAM: Alexa, have i taken my pills?

ask smart pillbox have i taken my pills
